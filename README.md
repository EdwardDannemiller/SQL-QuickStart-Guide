# SQL-QuickStart-Guide
This is the work I did while learning from Walter Shields SQL QuickStart Guide

The ISBN for this textbook is: 978-1-945051-75-3

The following is a blurb about the book from https://www.clydebankmedia.com/books/programming-tech/sql-quickstart-guide

"SQL QuickStart Guide – Structured Query Language or SQL (pronounced sequel by many) is the most widely used programming language used in database management, and it is the standard language for Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). SQL programming allows users to return, analyze, create, manage and delete data within a database – all within a few commands.

With more industries and organizations relying on the power of data, the need for an efficient, scalable solution for data management is required. More often than not, organizations find a solution through the implementation of a Relational Database Management System.

SQL QuickStart Guide is ideal for those seeking to increase their job prospects and enhance their careers, for developers looking to expand their programming capabilities, or for anyone who wants to take advantage of our inevitably data-driven future—even with no prior coding experience!

SQL QuickStart Guide shows you everything you need to know to utilize SQL in whatever capacity you may need in simple and easy to follow concepts. With step-by-step hand-on examples leading you the entire way through the text, you will be using the programming syntax in no time at all!"

Thank you for reading.

Sincerely,
Edward Dannemiller
